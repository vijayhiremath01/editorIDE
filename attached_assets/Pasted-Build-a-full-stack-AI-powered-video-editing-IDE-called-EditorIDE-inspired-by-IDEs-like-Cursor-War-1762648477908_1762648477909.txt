Build a full-stack AI-powered video editing IDE called EditorIDE — inspired by IDEs like Cursor, Warp, and VS Code — but designed for video editing automation.
🧠 Core Idea:
Users should be able to edit videos using natural language or typed commands. The system interprets these commands using an AI model (Google Generative AI or Gemini), processes the video via FFmpeg, and returns the output in real time with an IDE-like interface.
🧩 Architecture:
Frontend: React + Vite + TailwindCSS + Socket.IO client + Monaco Editor (for command typing) + video player with timeline preview.
Backend: Node.js + Express + Multer (for uploads) + FFmpeg-static + Fluent-FFmpeg + Socket.IO + @google/generative-ai for AI understanding.
Environment: .env file with GEMINI_API_KEY and other configs.
⚙️ Core Features:
Upload, preview, and manage video/audio assets.
Natural language command execution (e.g., “Trim first 10 seconds”, “Add music”, “Generate captions”).
Real-time progress tracking via Socket.IO.
Editable timeline and multi-layer track view.
Music volume control, text overlays, split/join clips, export to different formats.
AI command interpreter that converts text instructions into FFmpeg actions.
Error handling, logs, and re-execution panel like in IDEs.
🧰 Key Goals:
IDE-inspired layout: left (file explorer), center (timeline + preview), bottom (command console).
AI assistant panel that suggests editing options or auto-generates scripts.
Modular and extendable backend so advanced AI models (like Gemini 2.0 or OpenAI o1) can be plugged later.
🧠 Example Flow:
User uploads a clip.
Enters: “Trim first 10 seconds and overlay text ‘Hackathon Demo’.”
AI interprets → JSON instruction → FFmpeg executes.
Socket.IO streams updates → preview updates live.
🧩 Target Outcome (Prototype Level):
Fully working local prototype with video processing + AI understanding.
UI that feels like an IDE (keyboard shortcuts, dark theme, console logs).
Functional features: trim, merge, cut, volume adjust, overlay text, add background music, export.
Error-free communication between frontend and backend.
🎯 Theme Alignment:
“Agentverse – The Era of Autonomous Creation”
EditorIDE represents a creative autonomous agent — blending AI + human creativity like how developers and AI co-code together.
Goal: Deliver a working AI video-editing IDE prototype where users can control full video editing through text commands with responsive, IDE-like experience.
